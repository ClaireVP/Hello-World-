# Hello-World-
Hello GitHub! So excited to be starting my blog!!

Hey! So, if you're reading this you're probably bored to death and by chance, our stars alligned and you fortunately stumbled upon my blog. Now that I have your attention, I want you to leave. Haha honestly, just leave. Because how in the world could an 18 year old's words be possibly worthy of someone's attention and time? Yet with this fact in mind, I started a blog. One thing's for sure. I'm stubborn and fierce and my parents raised me right. 

So, I'm an 18 year old living in Europe. I try not to be an average teenager (an adult now actually according to society's standards -_-) and I'm hoping this won't be your average type of blog. I spend too much time for myself and I hope I'm making my parents proud by writing this. (Shoutout to my mama who deserves all the love and appreciation one could have). To be honest, in no way do I want to simply invest time for myself, scribbling down nonsense and making sense of my emotions, when in fact, there are so many other people starving and suffering out there who are more worthy of my attention- the world's attention, our attention. 

Which brings me to the next fact about myself. I am a devout Catholic, but with this blog I hope to keep religion and political beliefs at bay. However, that does not eliminate the fact that my religion makes up 90% of me. The other 10% being my family, friends and hopefully my prince charming.(Gentlemen, you may all line up now. The sign up sheet's posted and smacked onto my door.) Religion is rather not complicated for me though. Simply put, God gave me a choice and my choice is to love.  

I'm in high school, but I'm so lucky to say that I have it all; because if I didn't, I'd be lying and that would be a sin cause "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor." I may be pathetic, but God created man in His image so I'm destined to be divine. 
I know I said this isn't a stereotypical blog. Well, I lied. (Bless me Father for I have sinned against you. So sorry for my Non-Christian readers who don't comprendo the religious references. I promise that's my last one.) This entire blog will be dedicated to emotions. It's my guide to happiness and hopefully I'll be able to share my philosophy with all of you.

By writing this blog, I hope to at least, make hearts smile and hopefully change someone's life. 
Life is worth living, my dear friend, and I want you to know that if you're going through difficult times, you are not alone. I want to be there with you. I want to be there for you. I want my blog to give you what you need to overcome your situation. No one deserves to be sad. And no one definitely deserves to be sad alone. 
Thank you so much for reading the longest intro in the world. I really appreciate you sticking with me for the last 200 words. Hope you enjoy my blog! :) All the best, have a wonderful day and take care xx
OH WAIT! 

My name's Claire btw.
